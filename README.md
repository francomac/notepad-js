# notepad-js

This is a pure Javascript Notes manager component. This renders a form and list that manages as many notes as necessary. The Notepad displays, edits, deletes, and search notes. 

User performs two actions: Set the note's name and save this same note. Also search notes by name to edit. finally, notepad deletes notes doubleclickin on the note's list.
