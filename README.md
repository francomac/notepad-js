# notepad-js

This is a pure Javascript Notes manager component. This renders a note's list to manage as many notes as necessary. The Notepad displays, edits, deletes, and searches for notes. 

User performs two actions: Set the note's name and save this same note. Also, searches for notes by name to edit. finally, notepad deletes notes doubleclickin on each list's item.
